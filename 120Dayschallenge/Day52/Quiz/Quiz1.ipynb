    "\n",
    "- Gaussian\n",
    "- Poisson\n",
    "- Bernoulli\n",
    "- Multinomial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Multinomial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In Multinomial Naive Bayes, the likelihood function used to model the conditional probability of the features given the class is the Multinomial distribution.\n",

    "**2. In Multinomial Naive Bayes, how are the probabilities of the features calculated?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- By assuming that the features are independent\n",
    "- By assuming that the features are dependent\n",
    "- By using a linear regression model\n",
    "- By using a decision tree model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** By assuming that the features are independent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In Multinomial Naive Bayes, the probabilities of the features are calculated by assuming that the features are independent, which is why it is called \"naive\".\n",

    "- A probability distribution over classes\n",
    "- A binary classification label (positive or negative)\n",
    "- A continuous value\n",
    "- None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A probability distribution over classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The output of a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is a probability distribution over classes. It calculates the probability of each class given the input features.\n",

    "- Text data\n",
    "- Image data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Gaussian Naive Bayes is best suited for numerical data, where each feature has a continuous value. It assumes that the distribution of each feature is Gaussian (normal).\n",

    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the data\n",
    "- The distribution of the parameter or hypothesis before seeing the data\n",
    "- The distribution of the parameter or hypothesis after seeing the data\n",
    "- None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The distribution of the parameter or hypothesis before seeing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The prior distribution in Bayesian inference represents our knowledge or beliefs about the parameter or hypothesis before seeing the data.\n",

    "**6. What is the difference between Bayesian inference and classical (frequentist) inference?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bayesian inference involves the use of prior knowledge, while classical inference does not.\n",
    "- Classical inference involves the use of prior knowledge, while Bayesian inference does not.\n",
    "- Bayesian inference is only used for discrete data, while classical inference is used for continuous data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Bayesian inference involves the use of prior knowledge, while classical inference does not.\n",

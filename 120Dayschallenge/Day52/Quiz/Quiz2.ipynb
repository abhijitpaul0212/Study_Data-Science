    "**Answer:** AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** AUC (Area Under the Curve) is a measure of how well a binary classifier can distinguish between positive and negative examples. It measures the area under the ROC curve and provides a single score to evaluate the overall performance of a classification model.\n",

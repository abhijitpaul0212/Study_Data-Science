    "1. What is the distance metric used in the KNN regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Euclidean distance\n",
    "   - Manhattan distance\n",
    "   - Minkowski distance\n",
    "   - All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The KNN regressor can use various distance metrics, including Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distances, to measure the similarity between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the optimal value of k in the KNN regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A high value of k\n",
    "   - A low value of k\n",
    "   - It depends on the dataset\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It depends on the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The optimal value of k in the KNN regressor depends on factors such as the dataset's size, structure, and noise level. It is typically chosen using techniques like cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which of the following is not a disadvantage of the KNN regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The need for feature scaling\n",
    "   - The sensitivity to the number of features\n",
    "   - The sensitivity to outliers\n",
    "   - The high computation time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The high computation time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Compared to some other algorithms, the KNN regressor generally has a lower computation time, especially during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How does the KNN regressor handle missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It drops the data points with missing values\n",
    "   - It replaces the missing values with the mean or median of the feature\n",
    "   - It uses imputation methods to estimate the missing values\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It uses imputation methods to estimate the missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The KNN regressor can use imputation methods like mean or median imputation or k-nearest neighbor imputation to handle missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the main difference between the KNN classifier and the KNN regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The KNN classifier predicts discrete values, while the KNN regressor predicts continuous values.\n",
    "   - The KNN classifier uses a classification algorithm, while the KNN regressor uses a regression algorithm.\n",
    "   - The KNN classifier uses a different distance metric than the KNN regressor.\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The KNN classifier predicts discrete values, while the KNN regressor predicts continuous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The primary distinction is that the KNN classifier is used for classification tasks, while the KNN regressor is used for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the KNN regressor, if k is set to 1 and there are 5 nearest neighbors, what value will be predicted for a new data point with the following distances to its neighbors: 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 2.5?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 1.5\n",
    "   - 1.8\n",
    "   - 2.0\n",
    "   - 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** With k set to 1, the predicted value will be the value of the closest neighbor, which has a distance of 1.2 and a corresponding value of 1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If the KNN regressor is trained on a dataset with 100 data points, and k is set to 10, how many neighbors will be used to predict the value of a new data point?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 5\n",
    "   - 10\n",
    "   - 20\n",
    "   - 50\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** With k set to 10, the KNN regressor will utilize the 10 nearest neighbors to predict the value of a new data point.\n"

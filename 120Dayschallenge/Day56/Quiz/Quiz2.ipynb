    "**1. What is the mathematical technique used in PCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) Linear Regression\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) Gradient Descent\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "b) Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "PCA is based on the mathematical technique of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is used to decompose a matrix into its constituent parts. In the case of PCA, SVD is used to decompose the covariance matrix of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What is a Scree plot used for in PCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) To visualize the eigenvalues of the principal components\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) To visualize the correlation matrix of the dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) To visualize the original dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) To visualize the principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "a) To visualize the eigenvalues of the principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "A Scree plot is a graphical representation of the eigenvalues of the principal components in a PCA analysis. It is used to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain in the dataset, based on the magnitude of the eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Which of the following statements is true about PCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) PCA can only be applied to datasets with two dimensions\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) PCA is a supervised learning technique\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) PCA is used to increase the dimensionality of a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "c) PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "PCA is a technique used for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset by identifying the most important features that account for the greatest amount of variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is the role of eigenvalues in PCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) Eigenvalues are used to identify the most important features in the data\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) Eigenvalues are used to create the principal components\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) Eigenvalues are used to calculate the variance of the data\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) Eigenvalues are used to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "d) Eigenvalues are used to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "Eigenvalues are used to determine the amount of variance accounted for by each principal component. A Scree plot is used to visualize the eigenvalues and determine the optimal number of principal components to retain in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How is PCA useful in machine learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) It helps in identifying the most important features for prediction\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) It helps in creating a decision tree model\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) It helps in classifying data into different categories\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) It helps in evaluating the performance of a model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "a) It helps in identifying the most important features for prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "PCA is useful in machine learning because it helps in identifying the most important features that account for the greatest amount of variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Which of the following is a limitation of PCA?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) It is only applicable to datasets with a small number of features\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b) It requires prior knowledge of the dataset\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c) It may not always capture the important variations in the data\n",
    "   \n",
    "   d) It can only be used for supervised learning tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "c) It may not always capture the important variations in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "One limitation of PCA is that it may not always capture the most important variations in the data, especially if the data has complex relationships between the features.\n"

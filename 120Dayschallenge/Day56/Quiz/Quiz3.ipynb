    "**Answer:** \n",
    "b) The matrix must have distinct eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "For a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach, it must have a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors, which requires the matrix to have distinct eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   a) It provides a method for calculating the determinant of a matrix\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "Singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to extend the Eigen-Decomposition approach to handle non-square matrices, by decomposing the matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, and V, where U and V are unitary matrices and Σ is a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Which of the following is true of the eigenvectors of a matrix?**\n",
    "\n",
